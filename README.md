# Quick install & execution
```
$ git clone https://github.com/const-void/covid-19-spreadsheet
$ cd covid19-19-spreadsheet
$ pip install -r requirements
$ python ./covid19_data_gather.py
$ python ./covid19_data_gather.py </path/to/conf.json>
$ python ./covid19_data_gather.py sample_covid19_data_gather_conf.json
```

# Goal
I was pretty frusterated by how hard it was to answer simple questions--how many people HAVE covid, right now?  How does where I live, compare to where others live?  Are we doing ok, as a county, state, country? When I found out about the NYT data store, I jumped on it IMMEDIATELY.

I also wanted to facilitate  analysis - so while emails are created automatically, 
they are not sent; the idea is, I, as a sender review, covid-19 data and makes some sort of conclusion.

Otherwise...why generate spreadsheets at all?  If we aren't looking at data, thinking about what we see,
sharing our thoughts with others, it becomes a mindless data generation task; there are too many
spreadsheet generators, dumping data in a directory, never to be looked at, "just in case".

# JSON Configuration
Case sensitive!

`cov19_data_gather.py` without a command line parameter will look for a `covid19_data_gather_conf.json` file. If one
isn't found, `sample_covid19_data_gather_conf.json` is used as starting place. Note that `covid19_data_gather_conf.json` is in `.gitignore` -- this way you can have your own setup without having to worry about git collisions etc.

Alternatively, a given `/path/to/conf.json` can specified on the command line.

All json configurations are validated -- once at a schema level via `covid19_data_gather_conf.schema.json`, and again, to make sure the intended geographies are accurate - counties have to match both US & NYT data *exactly*, including case sensitivity.  

`los angeles, ca` will *fail* validation.  `Los Angeles County, CA` will pass.

There are two blocks, both required:
* "spreadsheets": {}
* "settings": {}

## "spreadsheets": { }
This block controls spreadsheet generation. Fiddle with these settings to hone in on geographies of interest. If an email will be spent, each spreadsheet generated is attached.  For a while, I was generating spreadsheets but not sending...but...what's the point?  The data isn't going anywhere.  When you want to look at a region -- add it in! When you are tire of it...take it out!

key | type | required | desc | example
--- | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------
us  | boolean | yes | controls generation of summary (US) level spreadsheet, consisting of all 50 states! | `"us": true`
state-detail | array of states | yes | controls generation of summary (state) level spreadsheets, consisting of each county in a given state.  One spreadsheet per state is generated. | `"state-detail": ['ND', 'SD']`
custom | list | yes | list of spreadsheets to generate. each property is a  spreadsheet name; property value is a state or a county, state.  One spreadsheet per property is generated. | `"custom": { "north_dakota": [ "Burleigh County, ND", "ND" ] }`

## "settings": {}
This configuration block controls the script itself.  Fiddle with these settings to change the data you see.  Don't like my take of a 28 day average case...lower it.  raise it.  what happens?   Want to change the comparative per scales?  Or exclude fast swathes of the country?  These settings allow you to do just that--manipulate the data as *you* see fit.

*Data Controls*
key | type | required | desc | example
--- | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------
case-min-benchmark | number | yes | minimum number of cases; acts a a reporting gate. If we want to eliminate low case load geographies, set this property to filter to the case loads we are interested in.  | `"case-min-benchmark": 1`
case-days-duration | number | yes | average case duration - used in active vs recovered calculations | `"case-days-duration": 28`
geography-per-county | number | yes | scaling factor for counties. Per capita is a value of one; cdc uses 100k. | `"geography-per-county": 100000`
geography-per-state | number | yes |  scaling factor for states. Per capita is a value of one; cdc uses 100k. | `"geography-per-state": 100000`

*Email Settings*
key | type | required | desc | example
--- | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------
send-email  | boolean | yes | send email if true | `"send-email": true`
send-email-client | enumeration | no | One of `Outlook` or `N/A`, sadly. | `"send-email-client": "Outlook"`
send-email-to | array of emails | no | List of email addresses to send to. | `"send-email-to": [ "a@bc.com" ]`
send-email-style | string | no | HTML styling for a swank email. | `"send-email-style": "font-family: Trebuchet MS; color:#25253b; font-size:14pt"`
send-email-greeting | string | no | HTML email greeting | `"send-email-greeting": "Hello!<br>"`
send-email-signature | string | no | HTML signaure | `"send-email-signature": "xoxo<br>Yours Truly!"`

# Spreadsheet Notes
To do

# Covid-19 Data
* The New York Times. (2020). Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States. Retrieved from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.

*Usage*
* The function `update_data` sync's Covid-19 via `git pull` into a sibiling directory c/o https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data :
```
covid-19-data/
  us-counties.csv
covid-19-spreadsheet/
  xlsx/
     <generated ouutputs>
```
* If the sibiling directory/repository is missing, it is created via a `git clone`
* The function `set_county_covid19_cases` loads covid-19 data into Counties, joining via `fips`. 

Col #  | Field Name  | Desc | Sample 
------ | ----------- | ---- | ------
1 | data | | `2020-01-21`
2 | county | | `Snohomish`
3 | state | | `Washington`
4 | fips | | `53061`
5 | cases | | `1`
6 | deaths | | `0`

# Geography Data
When NYT started reporting on covid-19, each day would introduce a slew of new US geographies.  Initially, I thought maybe
I could pull in the data as it was needed--but, as data came in, the performance impact just got to be too great. It is important to cache geograpy in adavnce - so that as data comes pouring in, it has a place to go.

# Population
Simply knowing geography and case wasn't enough--I wanted to know the sense of scale, and not 
just within a geography...but also *across* geographies.  How do counties compare to other counties? And states?

# Email Notes
Email is a bit limited.  Currently - no osx/linux email, and Windows email is via Outlook.

Outlook is standard in the enterprise world, but not at home.  I haven't figured out Win10 mail yet, and I don't have a Mac/Linux box to use.  I am unwilling to smtp - so clients TBR.

# TO DO 
* US Territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, etc)
* Win10 Mail
* Apple Mail
